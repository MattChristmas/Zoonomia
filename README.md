# Zoonomia
Scripts used in the analysis of the 241-mammal Zoonomia dataset for the upcoming publication: "Evolutionary constraint and innovation across hundreds of placental mammals" UNDER REVIEW

# Estimating genome-wide constraint: calculate_genome_constraint_fraction.R
This script provides an example of how we calculated a lower-bound estimate of the proportion of the genome under purifying selection based on phyloP values, for human, chimpanzee, house mouse, dog and bat

# Constraint at four-fold degenerate sites
This script was used to analyse constraint at 4-fold degenerate sites and their overlap with transcription factor binding sites

# 100kb bins constraint analysis
This script was used to analyse supplementary data file 2, for measuring constraint across the human genome in 100 kb bins

# Gene desert analysis
This script was used for analysing constraint in gene deserts and relating this to the location of gene deserts near developmental transcription factors

# UNICORNs
This script was used for analysing features of UNICORNs, in particular for showing they contain less variation with lower allele frequencies than other unannotated intergenic regions

# Constraint in repeats
This script was for analysing the distribution of constraint across human repeat families
